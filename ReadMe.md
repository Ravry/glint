    A (more or less) high-performance animated wallpaper application built using modern graphics libraries. 
    This project leverages the Vulkan SDK for rendering, GLFW for window management, GLM for mathematics, and 
    <code>fmt</code> for logging. <strong>Currently under active development.</strong>

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- [fmt](https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt) ‚Äì Fast, safe formatting library used for structured logging and debug output
- [Vulkan SDK](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/) ‚Äì Low-level graphics API for high-performance rendering
- [Vulkan Memory Allocator](https://github.com/GPUOpen-LibrariesAndSDKs/VulkanMemoryAllocator) ‚Äì manages memory allocations and resource creation
- [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/) ‚Äì Window creation and input handling
- [GLM](https://github.com/g-truc/glm) ‚Äì Header-only C++ mathematics library for graphics software
- [FFMPEG](https://ffmpeg.org/) ‚Äì handling video, audio, and other multimedia files and streams
- [Discord Social SDK](https://discord.com/developers/social-sdk) - integrating essential discord features into the application
- [nlohmann/json](https://github.com/nlohmann/json) - read and write to json files in cpp

## üöß Status

> This project is in **early development**. Core rendering is being established, with plans to support dynamic, animated desktop wallpapers on Windows and Linux.

## üì¶ Goals (Planned Features)

- Render animated graphics as desktop wallpaper
- Windows support
- Configurable settings (resolution, effects, scenes)
- Efficient resource management

## üöÄ Getting Started (Coming Soon)

Instructions for building and running the app will be added once the project reaches a usable state.

## ü§ù Contributing

Contributions will be welcome in the future once a stable base is reached. Stay tuned!
